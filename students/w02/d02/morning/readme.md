#SLIPPIN' THROUGH THE WEEK

###Let's review some of the concepts we covered this week.
Group assignments are below. Each numbered group should answer that respective numbered topic.

As a programmer, you'll be responsible for knowing your code AND defending your code to the head honchos. Let's get comfortable explaining code to each other!

We'll spend 5-10 minutes researching, and then each group will present their topic for 4-5 minutes, with questions, to the class. Each person in the group must speak at least once. Don't worry about being incorrect - we'll help nudge you in the right direction!


#####PARTNERSHIP ASSIGNMENTS:

Count off from 1 to 7.  Those are your teams!


#####Questions to Answer
1. Truthy and Falsey: discuss, with examples. List the 'falsey' things.
2. What is Git and Github? Why do we use it over other types of file-sharing? List and explain some basic commands we use.
3. Why do we write functions? (What problems do functions solve?). Show us some syntax for a function - write out a function that will take an input number and double it and another function that will take an input string and log 'true' if the string is at most ten characters in length
4. What are the different types of loops in JS? Give an example of each and discuss when you might want to use each type.
5. Array methods: what do push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), and .length do when called on an array?
6. More array methods: what do splice() and slice() do? Give us an example!
7. Objects! What is a JS object? How do we access its properties? What kinds of things can you put inside an object? Give an example of an object with different types of data contained inside.
