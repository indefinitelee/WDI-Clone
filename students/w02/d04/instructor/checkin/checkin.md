- is jQuery a framework or a library? Explain the difference.
  Library. 
  A library is a collection of code, functions, variable, and structures 
  packaged so one does not need to reinvent them every time. 
  It is more opinionated about how one needs to write code than a 
  framework. 

- How do you include jQuery in your projects?
  Link to the library via url. Or you could link to a js file with the full code in it. 

- What is the DOM?
  a tree structure of a website where each node is an object. 

- Give 4 examples of "events" we can listen to with JS.
   click, keyboard press, mouseOut, mouseIn


- Given the HTML in your starter code:
  - import jQuery in your html.
  - Use **jQuery** to represent the following scenarios.
  **Note:** Do not create any functions, just code a jQuery statement that will accomplish the task:
    - Select the body of the document.
    - Change the footer content to "I am a semantic tag :)".
    - Select only my favorite brand of sports apparel.
    - Make the background of the content section `lightblue`.
    - Get how many items are in the "brands" list.
    - Remove all brands
    - Think of your favorite clothing brand and append it to the list. It should have both the `brand` and `favorite` classes.
