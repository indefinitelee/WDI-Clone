# SLIPPIN' THROUGH THE WEEK

### Let's review some of the concepts we covered over the past few weeks.
Break into 7 groups. Each numbered group should answer that respective numbered topic.

As a programmer, you'll be responsible for knowing your code AND defending your code to the head honchos. Let's get comfortable explaining code to each other!

First, spend 15 minutes researching and discussing the topic as a group. Then each group will present their topic for ~5 minutes, with questions, to the class. Each person in the group must speak at least once. Don't worry about being incorrect - we'll help nudge you in the right direction!

##### Topics
 
1. What is the difference between Fetch and Node-Fetch? When do we use Fetch? When do we use Node-Fetch?
