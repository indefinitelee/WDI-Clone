This morning you will explore a really helpful Javascript library
called [Underscore.JS](http://underscorejs.org/). Underscore provides very handy helper functions for iterating and manipulating arrays and objects. It also gives more advanced and quite useful feature for function binding, chaining, front - end templates etc. 

Here are some of the methods to review:

1. `each`
2. `map`, `pluck`
3. `find`, `findWhere`
4. `filter`, `reject`
5. `every`, `some`, `contains`
6. `uniq`
7. `shuffle`
8. `range`

Questions to answer for each:

1. What does the function do? Explain it in your own way and don't
   just copy the docs.
2. Provide an instructive example of usage.
3. Provide an extensively  commented version of the source code for
   the function. 
4. How would you accomplish the same thing in Javascript yourselves?
   What makes the underscore implementation better (or worse)?
5. Give an example of where you would use the function in any of your
   own projects, assignments
