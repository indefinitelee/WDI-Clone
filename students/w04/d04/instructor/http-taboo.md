# HTTP Taboo(30mins)
  1. You'll need 15 - 20 index cards with the most common HTTP status codes. It's not a bad idea to have some duplicates. Here's a list of the more popular HTTP response codes:
    - 100
    - 200
    - 301
    - 302
    - 304
    - 307
    - 400
    - 401
    - 403
    - 404
    - 408
    - 418 (I'm a teapot - for fun)
    - 500
    - 502
    - 503
    - 504
    - 550
  2. Break class up into 5 even teams
  3. Give the teams the following prompt:
    - Each team will have 20 minutes to research and go over HTTP status codes
      * https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html
      * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
    - At the end of the 20 minutes each team will have a single volunteer who
    will have 1:30 on the clock to go through the stack of index cards and give
    their team worded hints trying to get HTTP status number from their team (**without using the HTTP status number OR any words from the HTTP status**)
    - Keep score of how many correct status codes each team guesses.
