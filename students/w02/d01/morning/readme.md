Kanye West, having recently mastered solo synchronized swimming, takes up coding as his next big thing.  Being a lyrical genius and master of language, he figures it shouldn't be a challenge.  While the two of you are sipping Hennessy poolside on an XL beanbag made of pure tiger fur, he looks you in the eye and says, "YO this code right here.  This'll change the game.  Check it brah."

A unicorn brings over a golden laptop and you see his code.  

Your palms get sweaty looking at his work.  There's no organization and it is utterly unreadable.  Fix his code (provided in starter.js) so that it abides by the [AirBnb Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)


_Hint:  The AirBnb styleguide has TONS of information and guidelines.  You should read everything at some point, but for this warmup just identify the components in each specific problem and find how it is styled in the styleguide_
