This morning we are going to practice some more html and css by buiding that handsome, well-dressed dog a new website! Any business is good business!

Try using Flexbox to arrange some of the content! Here's a helpful guide.

## Set Up

PARTNER UP! Just like with pseudocoding, we should spend five minutes planning out our HTML and CSS.

One person should WIREFRAME the webpage. Draw boxes around elements - it'll help you get a sense of what elements you need and where elements should be nested.

The other person should review the Flexbox guide and decide which containers need Flexbox and how elements within should be arranged.

After five minutes, come together to implement the design!

Work in the starter `index.html` and `style.css` files in the doggies folder.

## Completion

Get as far as you can! You should definitely have a plan

## Assignment

You need to recreate the mockup shown here

- What are the different aspects of this mockup? What are the largest elements/collections of elements you see?
- What elements appear to be nested within each other?
- Do any elements seem to have non-default styling?
- Is there anything in the starter code that might give you access to more style values?
