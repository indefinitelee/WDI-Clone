# SLIPPIN' THROUGH THE WEEK

### Let's review some of the concepts we covered over the past few weeks.
Break into 7 groups. Each numbered group should answer that respective numbered topic.

As a programmer, you'll be responsible for knowing your code AND defending your code to the head honchos. Let's get comfortable explaining code to each other!

First, spend 15 minutes researching and discussing the topic as a group. Then each group will present their topic for ~5 minutes, with questions, to the class. Each person in the group must speak at least once. Don't worry about being incorrect - we'll help nudge you in the right direction!

##### Topics
1. What is an ERD? What are some types of connections between tables? Show us an example of an ERD with all associated data for students, tests, questions, and answers.
2. What is a relational database? What are the advantages? What are the limitations?
3. What is SQL? What is Postgres? How would you create a database? Add a table to it? Insert two rows? Select data?
4. What is MongoDB? How is it different from a relational database? What are the advantages? Limitations?
5. What are promises? What is pg-promise? How have we used it?
6. What is Express middleware? What is it used for?
7. What is fetch? What is it used for? What are the advantages/disadvantages of fetch vs jQuery AJAX?
