It's Operation—the wacky doctor's game—that requires players to carefully replace the missing organs of a man with a strange diet. You've been tasked with doing the exact same thing, but using CSS.

## Setup

A file structure has been provided for you! Work in the existing files and make changes as necessary to server.js and to style.css.

#### Directions
1. Set up an Express application that will serve up the static files in `/public`.
2. Open up the index - take a look at the layout.
3. Alter the CSS to position the patient's heart, wishbone, bread, and butterfly in the appropriate spots.
4. You may need to rotate the images using CSS - find documentation that'll help you do that!
5. What happens if you resize your browser? Do the pieces stay in the right spot? Will playing with the CSS position help?
